# noobinterpreter
Small script language interpreter written in C due to boredom
I might update/work on it maybe someday

You need to add own xalloc stuff etc to compile

//TODO
* Wanted to rewrite to vm for easier thread/coroutine stuff (GSC thread, wait)
* More native types, rewrite the ipr_factor stuff
* Stack local vars etc
* Finish interpreter, compile to vm

file.i is example script
